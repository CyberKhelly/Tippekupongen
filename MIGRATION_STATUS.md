# TippeQpongen — Migration Status

Last updated: 2026-06-19

## Architecture overview

Three parallel systems coexist. All three share the same SQLite database and the same Python analysis pipeline.

| System | Entry point | Port | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Streamlit UI | `streamlit run app.py` | 8501 | Active — must not be broken |
| FastAPI backend | `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000` | 8000 | Active |
| Next.js frontend | `npm run dev` (inside `frontend/`) | 3000 / 3001 | Active — primary UI under development |

The Next.js frontend calls the FastAPI backend. Streamlit runs fully independently. Neither UI contains any model logic — all analysis runs in `analysis/`.

---

## Starting the stack

```bash
# Streamlit (from project root, Anaconda Python)
streamlit run app.py

# FastAPI backend (from project root)
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Next.js frontend (from frontend/)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Next.js production build (from frontend/)
node ./node_modules/next/dist/bin/next build
```

> **Note:** `python` is not in PATH on this machine. Use `C:\Users\kimme\anaconda3\python.exe` or activate the Anaconda environment. `npm` is at `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm`.

> **Known issue:** After major dependency changes or unexpected rendering failures, delete `frontend/.next/` and rebuild.

## Current working routes

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `http://localhost:3000/coupon` | Main coupon optimizer UI — the only active Next.js page |
| `http://localhost:8000/v1/coupons` | Active coupons (no week/year = non-expired, deduplicated) |
| `http://localhost:8000/v1/optimize` | POST — run optimizer for a coupon |
| `http://localhost:8000/v1/sync/status` | GET — sync state (last refresh times, omsetning, tip changes) |
| `http://localhost:8000/v1/sync/refresh-coupons` | POST — trigger NT data refresh (admin/backend only) |
| `http://localhost:8000/health` | GET — health check |

---

## Python path

```
C:\Users\kimme\anaconda3\python.exe
```

All Python commands in this project must be run from the project root `C:\Users\kimme\Desktop\Tippekupongen\`.

---

## Model constraints — do not change

- The analysis pipeline is `process_match() → run_model() → classify_match() → optimize_coupon()`.
- Bookmaker prior always has ≥ 87% weight. AF stats can adjust by at most `±_MAX_ADJ`.
- Strategies: **Safe**, **Balanced**, **Jackpot** only. Do not add, rename, or reorder.
- Balanced composite score formula: `score = confidence × clip(VI_at_pick, 0.75, 1.25)`.
- Do not add Elo, xG, or additional AI models.
- Model probabilities in `Match` are read-only — strategy and optimizer never write to them.

## Active coupon lifecycle (as of 2026-06-19)

### Current DB state

| coupon_id | Label | Deadline (CEST) | Fixtures | Omsetning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lordag-25-2026` | Lørdag — frist 2026-06-20 | 2026-06-20 14:55+02 | 12 | ~797k NOK |
| `sondag-25-2026` | Søndag — frist 2026-06-21 | 2026-06-21 15:55+02 | 12 | ~419k NOK |
| `midtuke-25-2026` | Midtuke — frist 2026-06-24 | 2026-06-24 23:55+02 | 12 | ~687 NOK (just opened) |

Old expired coupons (week 23, 24) remain in the DB for history/evaluation. They are not returned by `/v1/coupons` (no week/year).

### Important lifecycle rule

`/v1/coupons` with no `week`/`year` parameters now returns only active (non-expired) coupons, deduplicated by `nt_game_day_id`. This was added because the same NT game day was sometimes ingested under two different week numbers at a week boundary (e.g. `lordag-24-2026` and `lordag-25-2026` both referred to the same game day with the same `nt_game_day_id`). The deduplication keeps the entry with the higher week number.

### Bug fixed: fixture accumulation on content change

Previously, `ingest_game_days()` only cleared old `coupon_fixtures` rows when `force_refresh=True`. If the NT API returned a new set of matches for the same coupon (content hash changed), the new fixtures were appended on top of the old ones. This caused `midtuke-25-2026` to have 24 fixtures (two overlapping sets of 12). The bug is fixed: `coupon_fixtures` are now cleared whenever an existing coupon is about to be re-written, regardless of `force_refresh`.

To force-clean and re-import a specific week:
```bash
python -c "from ingestion.norsk_tipping import ingest_game_days; ingest_game_days(week=25, year=2026, force_refresh=True)"
```

---

## Turnover / omsetning

**Source confirmed:** `game.sales.fullTime.saleAmount.amount` in the NT `PoolGamesSportInfo/v1/api/tipping/live-info` endpoint.

**Storage:** `coupons.omsetning` (REAL column, added 2026-06-19 via `_PHASE1_COLUMNS`).

**Flow:**
1. `parse_live_info_response()` extracts `omsetning` from the NT API response.
2. `ingest_game_days()` writes it to `coupons.omsetning` via `upsert_coupon()`.
3. On hash-unchanged coupons, omsetning is still updated (it accumulates continuously).
4. `_get_turnover()` in `backend/scheduler.py` reads from `list_active_coupons()`.
5. `SyncStatus` in the frontend shows total omsetning when > 0 (collapsed panel, expanded view).

**Turnover is NOT shown for:** week 23 coupons (ingested before this column existed, have `NULL`).

---

## Automatic refresh (APScheduler)

`backend/scheduler.py` runs background jobs inside the FastAPI process:

- **NT check:** every 5 min tick, self-throttles to 60/15/5 min intervals based on time-to-deadline.
- **Odds check:** every 3 hours.
- State persisted to `data/sync_state.json` (thread-safe, atomic writes).
- Never calls `sync.py` functions that contain `sys.exit()`.

The frontend polls `/v1/sync/status` on an adaptive interval (5s when running, 30–120s otherwise). There is **no manual refresh button** in the user UI — refresh is fully automatic.

---

## Evaluation baseline

**Week 24/2026 Midtuke** is record #1 under the current CDS-driven model philosophy. All pre-baseline coupon records were cleared. Do not restore or compare pre-baseline data.

Evaluation pipeline: `evaluate.py` (Phase 8A). Tables: `coupon_save_snapshot`, `pick_evaluations`, extended `coupon_predictions` / `coupon_evaluations`.

## What must not change

- **Streamlit** (`app.py` and `pages/`) — must continue to work independently.
- **Optimizer logic** (`analysis/optimizer.py`) — do not alter.
- **Model logic** (`analysis/model.py`) — do not alter.
- **Strategy parameters** (`analysis/strategy.py`) — Safe / Balanced / Jackpot only.
- **Evaluation baseline** — Week 24/2026 Midtuke is record #1; no pre-baseline data to restore.
- **Old coupon records** in DB — expired coupons are hidden from the active list but must remain in the DB for history, Results, and evaluation pages.
- **`coupon_predictions` historical data** — never delete or backfill with live data.
